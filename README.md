# Dakaraneko

A bridge between the Dakara and the Karaneko projects.

## System requirements

* Python 3.

## Install


Clone the project with its submodule:

```sh
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Neraste/dakaraneko.git
```

Or initialise submodules if you have cloned without including them:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Refer to the parsers and config file in the Dakara commands.
